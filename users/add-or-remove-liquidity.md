# Add or Remove Liquidity

Addiing liquidity to JunoSwap will allow you to earn passive income through various reward functions. These functions include:

* Collection of swap fees from individuals using the swap function of JunoSwap. Your swap fees are calculated based on the percentage of the liquidity pool that your portion of liquidity represents. For example, if you had $50 in a liquidity pool with a total of $100, your liquidity would represent 50% of the pool. These fees are automatically added to your total liquidity as they are incurred.
* Liquidity incentives. There are various incentive mechanisms which reward liquidity providers in the form of additional tokens. These rewards are credited directly to your Juno wallet address.
